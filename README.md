## Summary

I like to reason about a lot of things chronologically, and I thought it'd be cool to have a tool that can ingest raw data and construct visually appealing visualizations from them automagically. I'm also interested in graph visualization algorithms. As a way of strengthening my React skills, I created this timeline project.

Sometimes LinkedIn profiles are hard to read, especially when people have many concurrent things going on, and so LinkedIn profiles are the first data source I used for this project. The following is an example of [Sergio Pereira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiomcpereira/)'s profile, a Fractional CTO whose work I follow:

## Improvements

I'd love to make the following improvements:

- Create scripts to easily ingest more data sources
- Create a headless scraper that can log into LinkedIn and access profiles automatically
- Snap "job bubbles" to a grid, making it more visually appealing
- Support a horizontal display mode

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
